Game Design Document (GDD) â€“ Trade Craft Online
1. Game Overview
TradeCraft Online is a browser-based MMO business and trading simulation set in a persistent, shared virtual world. Players join as one of several economic roles and participate in a real-time, interdependent player-driven economy. The core of the game revolves around production, logistics, services, lending, and market dynamics. The game is designed to be low-graphics but rich in systems and strategy.
Genre:
Business Simulation, Strategy MMO
Platform:
Browser-based (desktop and mobile supported)


Technology Stack:
Backend: Go (modular microservice architecture)


Database: MongoDB (document store for player, world, transaction data)


Real-Time: WebSockets using github.com/coder/websocket


Frontend: To be finalized based on UI needs (React/Svelte preferred)



2. Player Roles
Players choose a role when joining the game. Each role has defined abilities and restrictions, designed to encourage economic interdependence.
2.1 Banker
Starting Assets: High monetary capital


Abilities:


Provide loans to other players


Set custom interest rates and terms


Repossess assets on default (future feature)


Restrictions: Cannot produce or trade goods, cannot offer services


Progression: Expand to create banks, consortiums, and offer bonds or derivatives


2.2 Service Provider
Starting Assets: Steady income from basic job (e.g., mechanic, clerk)


Abilities:


Provide essential and luxury services


Gain experience (XP) and reputation through services to unlock raises and promotions. Higher levels make services more effective and profitable. Managing jobs unlock at higher XP tiers.


Restrictions: Cannot produce goods


Progression: Specialize in high-demand service sectors, form service chains


2.3 Entrepreneur
Starting Assets: Server loan + one basic factory


Abilities:


Produce one or more product types (food, cement, clothes, etc.)


Expand and optimize production facilities


Opens facilities like hospitals and repair centers as they are transitioned from server-operated services.


Can eventually take over electricity, health, and security services from the server as the player economy matures.


Restrictions: Can sell only to dealers (not end-users)


Progression: Unlock tech for advanced manufacturing, run production empires


2.4 Dealer
Starting Assets: Access to market interface and storage


Abilities:


Buy from entrepreneurs, sell to services or simulated end-user market


Monitor regional demands and price fluctuations


Restrictions: Cannot produce goods


Progression: Form regional distribution networks, influence prices, run trading guilds


2.5 Transporter
Starting Assets: One vehicle and a fuel quota


Abilities:


Deliver goods between regions and players


Upgrade fleet, optimize routes, reduce risks


Restrictions: Cannot produce or trade


Progression: Operate transport hubs, provide third-party logistics services


2.6 Security Service (Future/Optional Role)
Function:


Initially operated by the server to ensure essential transport risk mitigation and baseline gameplay support.


As the server population and player economy grow, these services will be gradually outsourced to entrepreneurs.


Offer paid protection for transports


Reduce risk of hijack/theft


Provide insurance services, either as NPC policies or player-managed


Adds opportunities for entrepreneurial growth and specialized roles in private security



3. World Structure
The game world is persistent and shared across all players. It is divided hierarchically:
3.1 Regions and Sub-Regions
Players are randomly placed in a sub-region upon joining


Sub-regions have independent markets, resources, and local conditions


Cross-region trade is encouraged for profit and demand balancing


3.2 Region Properties
Resource availability


Demand index for each product


Risk level (crime rate, economic stability)


3.3 Player Placement
Players are auto-assigned to sub-regions to balance load and market variety



4. Resources and Products
4.1 Core Resources
Money: Universal currency, used for all transactions


Products: Tradable commodities with unique uses and lifespans


4.2 Product Types
Product
Category
Use
Shelf Life
Food
Perishable
Essential daily commodity
Short (1-2 days)
Clothes
Perishable
Essential, slower consumption
Medium (1-2 weeks)
Wood
Construction
Used for building houses, hotels, etc.
Long
Metal
Construction
Used for machinery, structures
Long
Cement
Construction
Used for buildings, large projects
Medium
Fuel
Utility
Powers factories, transport
Consumable

4.3 Derived/Advanced Products (Future Expansions)
Electricity


Machinery


Tools


High-tech equipment (electronic goods, software)



5. Core Gameplay Mechanics
Server-to-Player Service Transition
In the early stages of a new server or region, essential services (e.g., health, electricity, security) are handled by the server to ensure basic functionality.


As player population and economy grow, these services are gradually transitioned to eligible Entrepreneurs.


Transition is triggered by server milestones like population density, XP thresholds, or demand index.


Entrepreneurs meeting certain criteria (XP level, reputation, infrastructure) will receive opportunities to bid or apply to take over the services.


Once transitioned, these services become part of the regular economic flow and player-managed operations.


5.1 Tick-Based Simulation
The game updates on a fixed tick interval (e.g., every 5 minutes)


All time-bound actions (production, transport, lending) are queued


Tasks continue while players are offline


5.2 Queued Action System
Players can queue multiple tasks: deliveries, production, loans, etc.


Queues are role-specific and influenced by player upgrades (e.g., automation)


5.3 Dynamic Economy
Region-based supply and demand models


Prices auto-adjust based on availability and player transactions


Essential goods (e.g., food) have constant baseline demand


Scarcity events (e.g., fuel crisis) shift player strategies


5.4 Transport & Risk
Transporters deliver goods across distances, with time and risk factors


Hijack, delays, and spoilage can affect delivery success


Security services can reduce risk


5.5 Market Operations
Centralized regional markets for bidding and offers


Price graphs and trade history available to dealers


Auctions, standing buy/sell orders, and direct player contracts


5.6 Reputation System
Each player has a reputation score (global + regional)


Impacts loan eligibility, faction invites, and trade priority


Grows via successful deals, timely deliveries, and loan repayment


Drops with defaults, delivery failures, or manipulation


5.7 Factions and Associations
Players can create or join factions (multi-tiered)


Factions enable:


Internal trading at lower taxes


Shared logistics and resources


Political and market influence (in future expansions)


5.8 Role Switching
Free role switch on new servers


Within-server switch allowed under:


Failure scenarios (e.g., entrepreneur bankruptcy)


Paid service or in-game token


Some global stats (e.g., net worth, reputation) persist across roles


5.9 Player Progression
Role-specific growth (e.g., factory upgrades, fleet size)


Unlock advanced production tiers or service offerings


Leaderboards based on:


Wealth


Trade volume


Reputation


Faction success


5.10 Monetization (Future)
Role change tokens


Faster task queues (non-pay-to-win)


Customization (badges, banners, avatars)


Advanced analytics dashboards for market trends


5.11 Win Conditions (Optional in future)
Dominance in a product category or region


Faction monopoly on trade or transport


Seasonal economic tournament-style servers



Next Steps
Go backend module design


MongoDB schema planning


WebSocket event model


Frontend structure recommendation (React/Svelte, dynamic dashboards)


End of Part 1. Backend breakdown to follow.
